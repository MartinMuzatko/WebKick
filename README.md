#WebKick


WebKick is an empty Template/Directory scheme to kickstart your HTML/CSS/JS Templates. It is only suited for development, not for production.

It is possible that you can find vendor scripts and css stuff here. Licenses will be added later.

##Based on the SMACSS principles


The folder structure and the code is based on the SMACSS principles for organizing CSS.
WebKick adds another bunch of standards to organize templates. This template of a template works best with TYPO3. But you can however, use it for any other basic templating engine or just build upon this work.

##Uniting best exercises.

Getting to know webdevelopment and/or design together with HTML and CSS is hard work. Getting it right together with applying coding guidelines and standards is another pair of shoes.

Seperating content from structure is the first step into a reasonable environment which you can extend and build upon.
