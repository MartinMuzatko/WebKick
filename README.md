#WebKick
##Introduction

This project used to be my empty projecttemplate for new templates.
With further enhancement, Webkick becomes the following.

WebKick is a lightweight Template/Directory scheme to kickstart your HTML/CSS/JS Templates which you can use for any CMS or Application.
Equipped with a lightweight modernizr alternative, it is suited for small and big projects of any kind.
You can, with sufficient knowledge, build in any CMS or environment you wish to.
Like any other project - it includes a lot of other open source to accelerate development.
This is not just another boilerplate, it is much more a way to organize your stuff with the benefits of easy and fun workflow.

Support for mobile will be added soon.

###Based on the SMACSS principles

The folder structure and the code is based on the SMACSS principles for organizing CSS.
WebKick adds another bunch of standards to organize templates. This template of a template works best with TYPO3. But you can however, use it for any other basic templating engine or just build upon this work.

###Uniting Best Practices

Getting to know webdevelopment and/or design together with HTML and CSS is hard work. Getting it right together with applying coding guidelines and standards is another pair of shoes. Seperating content from structure is the first step into a reasonable environment which you can extend and build upon. 

##Framework

###Grouping

Evenly divided elements can be achieved really quick!
you just have to give the parentelement the class `group` and it will divide all subelements.

```html
<ul class="group">
	<li>item 1</li>
	<li>item 2</li>
	<li>item 3</li>
	<li>item 4</li>
	<li>item 5</li>
</ul>
```

###Browser Testing Results

The Framework works with every modern browser. However, IE8 does not support the CSS3 autoframework.
